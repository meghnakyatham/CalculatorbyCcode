# Simple Calculator in C

This is a simple C program that acts as a basic calculator. The program takes an operator and two operands as input from the user and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).

## Getting Started

To run the calculator on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system. This program was tested with GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).

2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the source code file `calculator.c`.

4. Compile the program using the following command:


5. After successful compilation, run the executable:

- On Windows, use: `calculator.exe`
- On macOS or Linux, use: `./calculator`

## Usage

When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and then two operands (numbers) separated by commas. Type the operator and operands and press `Enter`.

The program will then perform the corresponding arithmetic operation based on the entered operator using the following rules:

- Addition (`+`): Adds the first operand to the second operand.
- Subtraction (`-`): Subtracts the second operand from the first operand.
- Multiplication (`*`): Multiplies the first operand by the second operand.
- Division (`/`): Divides the first operand by the second operand.

After the calculation, the program will display the result of the operation in the format:


If the entered operator is not one of the valid options (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), the program will display an error message.

## Example

Suppose you want to add two numbers, 5 and 3:


The program will show `5.0 + 3.0 = 8.0` as the result of the addition.
